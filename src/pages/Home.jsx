            Hello! I'm a third-year Informatics student at the University of Washington, working toward
            summer and fall 2026 software engineering internships. I'm interested in building impactful
            software across frontend, backend, and database systems.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
            I'm motivated by creating solutions that genuinely impact others. Whether it's building a 
            nail salon booking platform to empower a local nail tech or analyzing Washington State 
            datasets to uncover correlations between income and education, I enjoy creating things 
            that make a difference and don't shy away from responsibility.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
            Through my coursework, hackathons, and projects, I've explored full-stack development 
            and learned how different parts of a system come together. I'm comfortable moving across 
            the stack, improving user experience, optimizing backend logic, and designing reliable 
            data flows, and I enjoy learning new tools quickly when a problem demands it.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
            I thrive in fast-paced, high-pressure environments. I take initiative naturally, step into
            leadership roles when needed, and care deeply about consistency and growth. I believe real
            progress comes from showing up every day, working hard, and continuously improving—both
            technically and personally.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
            Right now, my goal is to strengthen my software engineering fundamentals while building
            meaningful projects and gaining real-world experience through internships. Long term, I want
            to continue developing scalable, thoughtful solutions that have tangible impact.
