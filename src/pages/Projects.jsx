    title: "Nail Salon Booking Platform (Client Project)",
    tagline: "A full-stack scheduling platform that modernizes appointment booking for nail salons.",
    problem:
      "Manual scheduling often leads to double bookings, inefficiencies, and poor customer experience for small service-based businesses.",
    solution:
      "Built a client-requested full-stack booking platform for the local business Happy Nails, enabling technicians to manage services, availability, and customer appointments in real time. The Spring Boot backend handles 6 unique entities, complex scheduling logic, and provides strong database integrity, while the responsive React frontend provides a smooth booking experience. Our client reported that the system reduced manual scheduling effort by approximately 70%, allowing technicians to focus more on service quality and customer satisfaction.",

    "title": "Viola: Advanced K-in-a-Row Game-Playing Agent",
    "tagline": "An intelligent game-playing agent that combines adversarial search with LLM-powered conversational features for strategic board games.",
    "problem": "Competitive game-playing agents must balance search efficiency with strategic depth. Naive minimax approaches scale poorly in large search spaces, and adding meaningful, context-aware agent interactions increases system complexity.",
    "solution": "Built Viola, a high-performance K-in-a-Row game-playing agent using minimax with alpha-beta pruning, Zobrist hashing for transposition table caching, and move ordering optimization. Reduced move computation time from over 24 seconds to 0.1 seconds in 5-in-a-Row games through intelligent caching. Integrated the Google Gemini API to generate persona-driven, musical-themed dialogue that explains strategic decisions and summarizes gameplay, combining strong algorithmic performance with engaging interaction.",

    solution:
      "Built during a 24-hour hackathon, this project automatically determines optimal departure times and adds reminders directly to users' calendars. The system leverages real-time transit data and event-driven cloud services to improve reminder accuracy and planning efficiency.",

    solution:
      "EcoTrack transforms waste reduction into an engaging, rewarding experience. Users log daily waste activities, earn points for sustainable actions, and visualize progress through interactive charts. A community leaderboard adds motivation through friendly competition, while personalized insights help users understand and improve their habits.",
