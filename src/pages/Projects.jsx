    title: "Nail Salon Booking Platform (Client Project)",
    tagline: "A full-stack scheduling platform that modernizes appointment booking for nail salons.",
    problem:
      "Manual scheduling often leads to double bookings, inefficiencies, and poor customer experience for small service-based businesses.",
    solution:
      "Built a client-requested full-stack booking platform for the local business Happy Nails, enabling technicians to manage services, availability, and customer appointments in real time. The Spring Boot backend handles 6 unique entities, complex scheduling logic, and provides strong database integrity, while the responsive React frontend provides a smooth booking experience. Our client reported that the system reduced manual scheduling effort by approximately 70%, allowing technicians to focus more on service quality and customer satisfaction.",

    tagline:
      "A privacy-first Chrome extension that estimates and visualizes the real-time water consumption of AI interactions across major platforms.",
    problem:
      "AI adoption is accelerating, yet most users remain unaware of its environmental footprint. Each prompt to systems like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini is processed in large-scale data centers that rely on water-intensive cooling, an invisible cost that compounds as AI usage grows globally.",
    solution:
      "Developed a Chrome extension that estimates water usage in real time using 2026 energy benchmarks from Google's Environmental Report and peer-reviewed academic research. During live demos, the extension processed over 1,000 prompts across six major platforms while keeping all user data local and aggregating only anonymous global totals via Firebase’s REST API. A floating widget visualizes both personal and collective impact using a six-tier scale (droplets → oceans), helping users contextualize consumption at a glance. Calculations run client-side in single-digit milliseconds and require no accounts or personally identifiable information.",

    "tagline": "An intelligent game-playing agent that combines adversarial search with LLM-powered conversational features for strategic board games.",
    "problem": "Competitive game-playing agents must balance search efficiency with strategic depth. Naive minimax approaches scale poorly in large search spaces, and adding meaningful, context-aware agent interactions increases system complexity.",
    "solution": "Built Viola, a high-performance K-in-a-Row game-playing agent using minimax with alpha-beta pruning, Zobrist hashing for transposition table caching, and move ordering optimization. Reduced move computation time from over 24 seconds to 0.1 seconds in 5-in-a-Row games through intelligent caching. Integrated the Google Gemini API to generate persona-driven, musical-themed dialogue that explains strategic decisions and summarizes gameplay, combining strong algorithmic performance with engaging interaction.",

    solution:
      "Built during a 24-hour hackathon, this project automatically determines optimal departure times and adds reminders directly to users' calendars. The system leverages real-time transit data and event-driven cloud services to improve reminder accuracy and planning efficiency.",

    solution:
      "EcoTrack transforms waste reduction into an engaging, rewarding experience.
